# Frontend

## TODO:

* Apply 'active' styling to main nav items and fish-finder filter buttons.
* Convert date in News cards to better format (Month DD, YYYY).
* Individual species pages should fetch data from backend api rather than use entire list of species.
* Fish finder banner text should change dynamically with page. 
* Auto-complete species search with dropdown menu. Use species name and species alias for search keywords.
