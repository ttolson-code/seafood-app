## Dockerfile

Docker cannot traverse backwards so it must be in the root directory with everything that needs to be copied into the container. Container is based on Ubuntu:20.04. 

Manually build the container: ```console
                              $ docker build -t seafood .
                              ```

```-t``` sets a tag so you can reference the docker image when running it.
