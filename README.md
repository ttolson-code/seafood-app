## Docker

Docker cannot traverse backwards so it must be in the root directory with everything that needs to be copied into the container. Containers are based on Ubuntu:20.04. 

### Requirements
  - Install docker
  - Install docker-compose

To build the containers run the following command from the root directory which contains the file `docker-compose.yaml`.

```console
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml build
 ```

To run the containers for local development run the following command from the root directory which contains the file `docker-compose.yaml`

```console
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yaml up
 ```

## Devops

The `devops` directory contains files for automated deployment and development.

localExport.sh contains a `$DB_URL` and a `$DB_NAME` variable. If you do not wish to use docker-compose you can run the following command `source ./devops/localExport.sh`. This will export the variables to your bash env where they will be consumed by `backend/config.js`.

```console
  mongoDb: {
    mongoUrl: (process.env.DB_URL),
    dbName: (process.env.DB_NAME),
    options: {
      useUnifiedTopology: true,
      useNewUrlParser: true,
    }
  }
}
 ```
